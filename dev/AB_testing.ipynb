    "### The problem (Taken from Kaggle Marketing A/B Testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "A marketing campaign was run to improve the sale. 96% received an advertisement while 4% didn't.\n",
    "The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups, find if the ads were successful, how much the company can make from the ads, and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    user id: User ID (unique)\n",
    "    test group: If \"ad\" the person saw the advertisement, if \"psa\" they only saw the public service announcement\n",
    "    converted: If a person bought the product then True, else is False\n",
    "    total ads: Amount of ads seen by person\n",
    "    most ads day: Day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads\n",
    "    most ads hour: Hour of day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   We randomly took only 2% of the original dataset (11,762 out of 588,100) for the sake of simplicity and minimizing the occupied GIT memory (and cloud run in future).\n",
    "   The dataset is checked out for missing values and data types. There is no missing values.\n",
    "   To keep A/B test clean, we'll only focus on test group (ad) vs control group (psa) in terms of the variable 'converted'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A/B testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Will be done by comparing the conversion rate diference between ad the test and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measure the statistical strength of the test:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Z-Test will be done and P-value will be measured.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Z-Test for Two Proportions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the converted variable is binary, so we’re comparing two proportions (conversion rates) from two independent Bernoulli samples.      Hence, the Null Hypothesis can be defines this way:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Null Hypothesis (H0): The two population proportions are equal (no difference in conversion rate).\n",
    "   Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The proportions are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let's assume ad and psa are groups A and B as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Group A (ad):\n",
    "   n1 users\n",
    "   x1 conversions\n",
    "   p1 = x1/n1 conversion rate\n",
    "\n",
    "   Group B (psa):\n",
    "   n2 users\n",
    "   x2 conversions\n",
    "   p2 = x2/n2 conversion rate\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then using formula for Z-statistic we can define:\n",
    "   p = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2) (total conversion rate or probability)\n",
    "   SE = (p(1−p)(1/n1 + 1/n2))^0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "   then the z-score that tells how many standard errors apart the two proportions are can be calculated:\n",
    "   z = (p1 − p2) / SE\n",
    "\n",
    "   Z-score is an good indicator for the statical strength of causal inference we need here and is interpreted as below:\n",
    "   If ∣z∣ is large enough (usially >= 2), the p-value (area under the normal curve beyond ±z) will be small.\n",
    "   A small p-value (typically < 0.05) lets us reject the Null Hypothesis and conclude the proportions differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. As was said, the other variables are not need for the A/B testing however the can be useful for Post-hoc Optimization. In other words, after proving the campaign worked, we might wonder:\n",
    "    What ad frequency is optimal?\n",
    "    What time/day performs best?\n",
    "\n",
    "    These are possible with exploratory/predictive modeling that will help to optimize campaigns by finding the best ad frequency, etc.\n",
